### Haply Device Support Components

**License:** GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)

When the CHAI3D library is built with `ENABLE_HAPLY_DEVICES=ON`, the Haply
device integration components are included under GPLv3 license.

**Components affected:**
- Haply-API-cpp (device driver integration)
- Haply device classes in CHAI3D

**Implications:**
- If you distribute binaries built with Haply device support, you must comply
  with GPLv3 terms (provide source code, preserve license notices, etc.)
- For proprietary/closed-source projects, contact Haply for commercial licensing
- For research and educational use, GPLv3 is typically sufficient
